## Attendees

- Tom

- Vinni
- James William Hollingsworth (via Zoom)

## Discussion

- Vinni made a domain model
- Sable made some use cases

- Worked on use cases and domain model in group
- We aren't going to implement a shopping cart
- An order only has one listing, although they can buy multiple of the same listing (quantity).
- Need to clarify what sort of domain model we're making
  - No methods (Luke)
  - No types (Luke)
  - For things that are more like actors (like an auctioneer) we don't need to add them to the domain model (Luke)
- Got rid of marketplace object because it is kind of redundant (just represents the whole system)
- When a new seller group is created, it must have at least one seller. A seller group cannot have less than one seller. If a group goes from 1 to 0 sellers it should be deleted.

## TODOS

- Domain model and use cases are pretty much done.
- Just allocate whatever's left in the report, and communicate via Slack.
